Thatâ€™s it! Your app will be up and running at http://myapp.dev/

in the command line :

- bundle install

- rake db:migrate

- rake db:seed

start the server 

- rails s -p 8080 -b 0.0.0.0

replace -p with your port and -b with an ip address (or omit -b and its argument)

##end points


localhost:8080/admin/

create a user in rails console
User.create({email: "max@marketplace.com",
                          password: "12345678",
                          password_confirmation: "12345678"})
